Given two arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.
A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. Gor instance, [1,3,5] is the subsequence of the array [1,2,3,4,5]. Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequence of the array.
