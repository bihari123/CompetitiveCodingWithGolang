Write a function that takes in a non empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing the target sum.If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any order. But if no two numbers sum up to the target sum, the function return an empty array.

Note that the target sum has to be obtained be summing twi different integers in an array; you can't add a single integer to itself in order to obtain the target sum.
You can assume that there will be at most one pair of numbers summing upto the target sum.

Sample input:
array: [3,5,-4,8,11,1,-1,6]
targetSum: 10

Sample Output: [-1,11]
